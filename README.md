# Semantic Components

A collection of accessible, customizable UI components for Angular applications.

## Features

### Modern Angular Architecture

- **Angular 21+** with standalone components (no NgModules)
- **Signals** for reactive state management
- **OnPush change detection** for optimal performance
- **TypeScript-first** with strict type safety

### Declarative

- **State-driven UI** - Control components through template bindings, not imperative methods
- **No .open() calls** - Use `[open]="signal()"` instead of `dialog.open()`
- **Template-based** - Everything lives in your templates, easy to see and understand
- **Reactive by default** - UI automatically updates with your state

### Composable

- **Slot-based architecture** for building complex UIs from simple parts
- **Mix and match** components to create custom experiences
- **Headless patterns** that separate logic from presentation
- **Flexible composition** for any use case

### Comprehensive Component Library

- **70+ production-ready components** including forms, navigation, data display, and feedback
- **Advanced components** like Data Tables, Charts, Rich Text Editor, Kanban Board, and more
- **Form components** with validation, field composition, and accessibility built-in

### Accessibility First

- **WCAG AA compliant** with full keyboard navigation
- **ARIA attributes** and semantic HTML
- **Focus management** and screen reader support
- **Color contrast** and responsive touch targets

### Modern Styling

- **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling
- **CSS custom properties** for easy theming
- **Dark mode support** built-in
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

### Developer Experience

- **Comprehensive documentation** with live examples
- **Type-safe APIs** with input/output functions
- **Predictable patterns** across all components
- **Tree-shakeable** for optimal bundle sizes
